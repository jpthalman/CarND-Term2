# Overview
In this project, I created a particle filter with the purpose of localizing a vehicle using only an initial noisy GPS measurement, inertial predictions of state, and lidar measurements of pre-mapped landmarks.

## Running the Code
Once you have this repository on your machine, `cd` into the repository's root directory and run the following commands from the command line:

```
> ./clean.sh
> ./build.sh
> ./run.sh
```

> **NOTE**
> If you get any `command not found` problems, you will have to install 
> the associated dependencies (for example, 
> [cmake](https://cmake.org/install/))

If everything worked you should see something like the following output:

Time step: 2444
Cumulative mean weighted error: x .1 y .1 yaw .02
Runtime (sec): 38.187226
Success! Your particle filter passed!

```
Otherwise you might get
.
.
.
Time step: 100
Cumulative mean weighted error: x 39.8926 y 9.60949 yaw 0.198841
Your x error, 39.8926 is larger than the maximum allowable error, 1
```

## Inputs to the Particle Filter
You can find the inputs to the particle filter in the `data` directory. 

#### The Map*
`map_data.txt` includes the position of landmarks (in meters) on an arbitrary Cartesian coordinate system. Each row has three columns
1. x position
2. y position
3. landmark id

> * Map data provided by 3D Mapping Solutions GmbH.


#### Control Data
`control_data.txt` contains rows of control data. Each row corresponds to the control data for the corresponding time step. The two columns represent
1. vehicle speed (in meters per second)
2. vehicle yaw rate (in radians per second)

#### Observation Data
The `observation` directory includes around 2000 files. Each file is numbered according to the timestep in which that observation takes place. 

These files contain observation data for all "observable" landmarks. Here observable means the landmark is sufficiently close to the vehicle. Each row in these files corresponds to a single landmark. The two columns represent:
1. x distance to the landmark in meters (right is positive) RELATIVE TO THE VEHICLE. 
2. y distance to the landmark in meters (forward is positive) RELATIVE TO THE VEHICLE.

> **NOTE**
> The vehicle's coordinate system is NOT the map coordinate system.

## Results
The particle filter I implemented was able to localize the vehicle with the following errors over 2,443 time-steps:

- Cumulative X Translation: 0.111507
- Cumulative Y Translation: 0.102905
- Cumulative Yaw: 0.00363314

To achieve these results, I used 50 particles which ran in ~1 second on an i7-3770 processor.
